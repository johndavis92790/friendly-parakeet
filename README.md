# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

I created 3 main functions: reset, prompts and generatePassword. These allowed me to keep the main actions that you perform seperated and organized. The reset function allows me to reset the values in a few variables in a couple different situations to keep the values from mixing up the data from previous passwords.

I learned about how to use different variables and when to set their values to use them in different situations. I learned that variables are thruthy by default. I learned how to create an array from a string to keep the code to a minimum.
